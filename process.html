            <h2>Adopt Through Our Website</h2>
            <p>Adopting through our website is designed to be a hassle-free and straightforward experience. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you through the process:
                <br>
                <p>
                    <strong>Browse Available Pets:</strong> Start by visiting our website and browsing through the profiles of pets available for adoption. You'll find a variety of animals looking for their forever homes, each with their own unique personality and characteristics.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    <strong>View Pet Profiles:</strong> Click on the profiles of pets you're interested in to learn more about them. Our website provides detailed information including age, breed, temperament, and medical history. You can also view photos to get a better sense of their appearance.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    <strong>Submit Adoption Application:</strong> Once you've found a pet that captures your heart, you can fill out an adoption application directly through our website. The application will ask for some basic information about you and your living situation to ensure that you're a good match for the pet.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    <strong>Application Review:</strong> Our dedicated adoption team will carefully review your application to ensure that you're a suitable candidate for the pet you've chosen. We may reach out to you for additional information or clarification if needed.

                <p>
                    <strong>Meet-and-Greet:</strong> If your application is approved, we'll contact you to schedule a meet-and-greet with the pet. This is an opportunity for you to spend some time getting to know the animal in person and see if there's a good connection between you.
                </p>
                
                <p>
